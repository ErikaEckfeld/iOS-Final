iOS App Development Final Project - Book Club Meetup

For my final project, I have created a Book Club Meetup application that reads data from a JSON file and parses it into a User Friendly list view so that they can see if there is a book they are intrested in discussing at a local library. The list includes a thumbnail icon equipped to fix multiple iOS resolutions, the title of the book/author, and where/when the book club meetup will happen. In the future, I would like to have real data coming in and have the user select their location for local library book club discussion happening specifically around them.
